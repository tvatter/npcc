"""Declare the placement this package's estimators evaluate on.

pyvinecopulib draws three separable steps over every input -- *placement*,
onto the dtype and device the object's own tensors live on; *layout*, the
shapes it admits; and *domain*, clamping copula arguments into the open unit
square. The first two are overridable hooks per level, ``_prep`` and
``_layout``; the domain step is the module-level ``trim`` that ``_prep_args``
applies after them.

The ``_prep`` hook itself is upstream's
:class:`~pyvinecopulib.torch.TensorPlacementMixin`, which resolves a placement
in three steps: a registered floating-point tensor, then a ``device`` and
``dtype`` the host *declares*, then an empty CPU ``float64`` tensor. None of
these estimators is a ``torch.nn.Module``, so the first step finds nothing and
the second is the one that applies -- which is all
:class:`TensorPlacement` supplies.

Two things about that are worth keeping in view.

**The mixin goes ahead of the canonical base.** All four bases already inherit
``PlacementMixin``, so a mixin placed *after* one never wins the lookup and
``_prep`` silently becomes the array-API inference again.

**``as_tensor``, not ``asarray``, is what keeps a gradient.** The array-API
route delegates to ``torch.asarray``, whose default for ``requires_grad``
changed -- silently ``False`` on torch 2.11, ``obj.requires_grad`` from 2.13.
The hook's ``as_tensor`` has always carried it, so the answer here does not
depend on which torch is installed.
