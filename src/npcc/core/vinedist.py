  """Original-scale distribution backed by a Rosenblatt vine.

  The distribution is constructed from an unfitted or fitted vine copula and
  one margin per variable. The inherited :meth:`fit` method first fits the
  existing margins, transforms the observations to the copula scale, and then
  fits the existing vine copula along its fixed structure.

  The fit controls name the placement, and the observations are brought onto
  it -- so a NumPy array or a CPU tensor handed to a CUDA-configured
  distribution is converted rather than refused.

  Notes
  -----
  This class intentionally does not declare ``vinecop_class`` or
  ``margin_class``. The generic :meth:`VinedistBase.from_data` construction
  path cannot create a non-simplified Rosenblatt vine correctly. Construct
  the required parts first and then call :meth:`fit`.

    The **controls** decide the placement and the data follow, not the other
    way round. Every other part of the lane is built from the controls -- the
    conditional margins through
    :func:`~npcc.core.registry.create_backend`, the vine through its own
    ``device`` argument -- so reading the placement off ``y`` instead would
    leave the margins wherever the caller's data happened to be while the pair
    copulas went to the controls' device, and the first concatenation of the
    two would fail.

    ``float64`` throughout, which is this package's working precision: an
    integer ``y`` would otherwise give the margins an integer grid.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y : object
        The caller's observations, in any form ``torch.as_tensor`` accepts.
    weights : torch.Tensor, or None
        Observation weights. Refused one level up, since
        :attr:`supports_weighted_copula` is ``False``; placed here anyway so
        the hook stays correct if that changes.
    controls : ControlsLike, or None
        Fit configuration. Its ``device``, when it has one, is the placement.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple of (torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor or None)
        The observations and weights, on one device in one dtype.
